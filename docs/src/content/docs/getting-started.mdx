Add a scroll to top button to your documentation website.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have a Starlight website set up.
If you don't have one yet, you can follow the ["Getting Started"](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started) guide in the Starlight docs to create one.

## Installation

import { Steps, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

<Steps>

1. `starlight-scroll-to-top` is a Starlight [plugin](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/plugins/). Install it by running the following command in your terminal:

   <Tabs syncKey="pkg">

   <TabItem label="npm">

   ```sh
   npm install starlight-scroll-to-top
   ```

   </TabItem>

   <TabItem label="pnpm">

   ```sh
   pnpm add starlight-scroll-to-top
   ```

   </TabItem>

   <TabItem label="Yarn">

   ```sh
   yarn add starlight-scroll-to-top
   ```

   </TabItem>

   </Tabs>

2. Configure the plugin in your Starlight [configuration](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/configuration/#plugins) in the `astro.config.mjs` file.

   ```diff lang="js"
   // astro.config.mjs
   import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight'
   import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
   +import starlightScrollToTop from 'starlight-scroll-to-top'

   export default defineConfig({
     integrations: [
       starlight({
   +      plugins: [starlightScrollToTop()],
         title: 'My Docs',
       }),
     ],
   })
   ```

3. [Start the development server](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/#start-the-development-server) to preview the plugin in action.
